# Transmitter Settings

At EOLab we used to use the **Graupner MX-20 HoTT 2.4 GHz** radio, unfortunately the company went bankrupt in 2012, since then the software support of the radio disappeared, it is difficult to find resources or update the firmware of the radios, and the usability of the radios in general was not the best.

Currently we exclusively use the [RadioMaster TX16S Mark II](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/collections/tx16s-mkii/products/tx16s-mark-ii-radio-controller) with an ELRS (ExpressLRS) built-in radio for all our self-built drones.

> [!NOTE]
> If you wish to configure a new radio, update the firmware or customize the functionalities follow the instructions on the page for developer: [Radio Setup](/development/radio-setup)
