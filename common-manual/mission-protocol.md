# Mission Protocol (Template)

## Pre-Mission Planning

- Mission Objective: Clearly define the purpose of the drone flight (e.g., aerial photography, surveying, inspection).
- Location Analysis:
  - Flight Area: Identify the flight location and ensure it is clear of hazards like power lines, trees, and buildings.
  - Airspace Restrictions: Check for any restricted airspace (near airports, military zones) using tools like airspace maps or apps (e.g., AirMap, DJI Fly).
  - Weather Conditions: Check for weather conditions that may affect the flight, such as wind speed, rain, or visibility.
  - No-Fly Zones: Confirm any nearby no-fly zones and avoid them.


## Equipment Preparation and Checks

Verify the correct and full functionality of all the equipment before the mission. This should be done before leaving the lab.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- Flight Path: Plan and review the intended flight path, altitude, and waypoints if necessary.
- Emergency Procedures: Establish clear emergency procedures, including return-to-home (RTH) settings, loss of signal protocols, and manual control overrides.
- Team Coordination: If a team is involved, ensure all members (e.g., spotters, visual observers) are briefed on their roles.
- Risk Assessment: Identify potential hazards and implement mitigations (e.g., stay clear of obstacles, maintain visual line of sight).

## Flight Execution

- Pre-Flight Check: Conduct a final systems check, including compass calibration, GPS lock, and battery status.
- Take-Off: Perform a controlled take-off and hover at a low altitude to ensure stability before proceeding.
- Monitor the Flight: Keep an eye on telemetry data (battery life, altitude, etc.) throughout the mission.
- Maintain Visual Line of Sight (VLOS): Ensure the drone remains within VLOS unless operating under specific beyond-line-of-sight conditions.

## Post-Flight Procedure

- Safe Landing: Ensure a safe and controlled landing.
- Data Collection: Retrieve and back up any data collected during the flight (photos, videos, or sensor data).
- Equipment Inspection: After landing, inspect the drone for any damage and check the battery status.
- Flight Log: Record details of the flight (location, duration, any issues encountered).
