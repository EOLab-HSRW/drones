# Introduction

Welcome to the introduction. The purpose of this page is to clarify the scope of this documentation, as well as to serve as a starting point to start working with EOLab Drones.

This documentation is designed for three types of readers/users, and makes a **strong assumption** that everyone knows **the basics of drones**:
- **Operators/Pilots**: This user is primarily interested in performing manually operated missions, so the [Common Operational Manual](/common-operational-manual/README.html) section covers all the information necessary for an operator/pilot to use our self-built drones.
- **Developers (application layer)**: This user is interested in performing assisted or autonomous missions with our drones, so the [Developers](/developers/README) section provides indispensable resources to develop autonomous applications.
- **Maintainers**: User in charge of maintaining the hardware and software infrastructure for the previous users as well as the documentation.

*What if you are not yet familiar with the basics of drones?* in that case you can visit the external link [Basic concepts - PX4 Docs](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/getting_started/px4_basic_concepts.html). For now there are no intentions to include educational material to start from zero on drones as this only increases the overhead of the documentation.

## The Cores

The following section is purely informative, and is intended to point out the projects that are at the core of our drones. Depending on the type of reader/user you are, you should be familiar with them.

Hardware core (for Operator/Pilots, Developers and Maintainers): [Pixhawk](https://pixhawk.org/) is defined as **Open (Hardware) Standard**: "Pixhawk open standards provides readily available hardware specifications and guidelines for drone systems development".

Software core: [PX4](https://px4.io/) "Open Source Autopilot". Why PX4 ? TBA

Application core: [ROS](https://www.ros.org/).... TBA
